# SkinWise: Skin Disease Classification Application

## Executive Summary
The data from Pitewi Community Health Center in the East Arso District of Keerom Regency reveals a troubling upward trend in skin disease cases over the past three years. The number of reported cases has escalated from 93 in 2019 to 116 in 2020, and further to 134 in 2021. This surge has propelled skin diseases into the list of the top ten health concerns plaguing the community, underscoring a critical need for increased public awareness and proactive measures towards skin health maintenance.
By prioritizing preventive measures, such as regular skin screenings and protective practices, healthcare systems can experience a significant decrease in the demand for extensive treatments, leading to lower medical costs. Additionally, heightened awareness and proactive attitudes towards skin care can substantially improve individuals’ skin health, which is closely linked to increased comfort and self-esteem, enhancing their overall well-being.
The purpose of skin diagnosis applications represents a significant advancement in dermatological healthcare, offering a user-friendly and efficient approach for individuals to monitor their skin health, thereby supporting early detection and personalized care strategies. This app will also help the user to find nearby hospitals according to their location. For this first phase of development, we limit the hospitals only for hospitals in big cities in Indonesia.


## Introduction
The advent of skin detection applications marks a significant shift from traditional methods, primarily due to their enhanced efficiency. These applications, powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, offer a more time and cost-effective solution, eliminating the constant need for a doctor's presence. They are designed to provide quick and accurate diagnoses, thereby streamlining the process significantly. This technological advancement not only expedites the diagnostic process but also ensures a high degree of accuracy, making it a revolutionary step in the field of dermatology. Thus, the integration of these applications signifies a transformative approach in healthcare, bridging the gap between technology and medicine.
